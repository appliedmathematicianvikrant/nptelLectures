   An architecture of database system
                 
Physical level : describes how  a record is stored
Logicallevel: describes data stored in database and the relationship among the data
View level: application program tries to bview the data
it hide details of data type
Example: when a stuident see university database a student not be able to see a instructor's salary or the grades so these details are hide

Schema: 
Logical schema:  The way in which data is organized. It is a plan
Example name , ID  needs to be present for a customer is customer schema.
account, interestrate comes in account schema

Instance:  the actual content of the databse at a particular point of time.
analogous to the value of a varaible

Physical data independence:  the ability to modify the physiocal schem without chaning the logical schema.

Datamodels:
A collection of tools for desxcribing the data
1.Data
2. Data relationships
3. Data constraints


most widely used is Relational model focus in this course
For database design Entity relationship data model is good choice

Objects based data base models
Semistructured data model

DDL : Data definition language
part of the language used toi define the schema
create table  for example

DDL compiler gerates a set of table stored in data dictionary
data dictionary contains metadata


DML :  accessing and manipulation
update  also called query klanguage

Two classes of languiage
1. Relational algebra
tuple
2.Commerical
SQL is most used commerical language

It is not a turing machijne equivalent language
not everything can be done in this language

Logical design:  
Buisaness decision: what atrributes should we choose in the relation
Computer science deciosn:  

Physical design:
